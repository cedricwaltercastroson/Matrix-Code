This project started off as an obsession to get a screensaver matrix style.
Unfortunately when I searched online, I could not find anything staying true to the art style and behaviour, especially they were video based and all mostly written with shaders and C# to achieve the effects.
And the blasphemous of them all, was a terminal window simply invoking "random" command..

So I decided to write my own in C language.
I say this with confidence, that this is the only C and SDL2 implementation of the Matrix Rain Code out there.

This is project is quite personal to me so please respect it but I believe in sharing the code and knowledge.

Have fun seeing blondes, brunettes, and redheads!
